            <p>Here we are at the beginning of a New Year! 2022 is here with all the promise and potential that every
                New
                Year provides us. Of course, as with every New Year, there are many things that are beyond our control.
                But
                it is important to focus on what we can control. Among them are our attitudes, our conduct, our words,
                and
                our goals. </p>

            As the year continues and I reflect on what I want for myself and for my life this year, I can't help

            my vision for the future.
